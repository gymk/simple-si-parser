# simple-si-parser
A CPP based minimal DVB-SI parser

When you look into Private Section format and DVB-SI derivation from it, it follows what 'Inside the C++ Object Model' book refers as 'ADT Style'.
Each Section just abstracting the private section format.
So I designed this simple-si-parser having ADT in mind (OB - Object Based), not OO (Object Oriented).
